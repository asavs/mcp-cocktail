# Tooling scorecard

Which of the three arms to reach for, and the trials that justify it.

Protocol: [tooling-experiment.md](tooling-experiment.md). Arms: **A** = `unity`
CLI, **B** = MCP official (`mcp__unity-editor-mcp__*`), **C** = MCP CoplayDev
(`mcp__unityMCP__*`).

## Capability matrix

The working answer to "which arm should I use". Update it when a trial changes
the picture, and cite the trial.

| Use case | Best | Avoid | Confidence | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Install / uninstall editors and modules | **A** | B, C — impossible | High | Structural: MCPs need a live Editor |
| Open / close projects, license, auth | **A** | B, C — impossible | High | Structural |
| Headless / CI / no Editor running | **A** | B, C — impossible | High | Structural |
| Live scene-graph inspection | **B** or **C** | A — impossible | High | Structural: CLI has no scene access |
| Reading Editor console / compile errors | **B** | — | Medium | T-000; `get_console_logs` returned structured data immediately |
| Invoking Editor menu items | **B** | — | Medium | T-000; `menu` executed and listed all 873 items |
| Editor lifecycle (quit, play mode) | **B** | — | Low | T-000; `File/Exit` worked but errored on response as the server died |
| Scripted / repeatable setup | **A** | — | Medium | T-000; every CLI step was reproducible, GUI steps were not |
| GameObject / prefab authoring | ? | — | None | **Untested** |
| Script creation + attach + recompile | ? | — | None | **Untested** |
| Builds and test runs | ? | — | None | **Untested** — A and B both offer it |
| Asset import / settings changes | ? | — | None | **Untested** |
| Multi-client environments | **C** | — | Medium | 22 configurators vs ~16; structural |

Most rows are empty on purpose. Six of the filled ones are **structural** —
true by architecture, not worth a trial. The interesting rows are the `?`s.

### Standing observations

Short version, with the detail living elsewhere — this file is for verdicts,
[UNITY-TOOLING-NOTES.md](../UNITY-TOOLING-NOTES.md) is for observations.

- **A fails quietly** — returns confident wrong answers rather than errors.
  [Detail](unity-cli.md#scripting-the-cli).
- **B has the better safety model** (`confirm=true`, `dry_run`, path
  confinement) — and ships `eval`/`eval_file`, which bypass all of it.
  [Detail](unity-mcp.md#security-notes).
- **B's errors are unusually good** — `unity list` names all three
  prerequisites when the Pipeline isn't reachable. Use it as the benchmark.
- **C is GUI-gated** — setup can't be fully scripted, making it the most
  expensive arm to stand up on a fresh machine.
  [Detail](unity-mcp.md#coplaydev-mcp-for-unity).
- **C binds loopback, B binds every interface.** CoplayDev listens on
  `127.0.0.1:8080`; Unity's Pipeline listens on `0.0.0.0:7800` while reporting
  its own URL as `127.0.0.1`. On this one dimension C is the better-behaved
  server. [Detail](unity-mcp.md#security-notes).

## Trials

Newest first. Template at the bottom.

### T-000 — initial setup of CLI, both MCP servers, and the git merge driver

**Date** 2026-07-28 · **Category** setup · **Mutating** yes ·
**Versions** CLI `1.0.0-beta.3`, Editor `6000.5.5f1`, Pipeline `0.4.0-exp.1`,
MCP for Unity `v10.0.0`

Not a controlled trial — this was the bootstrap, done before the protocol
existed. Recorded because it's the only evidence behind several matrix rows and
because "how hard was each arm to stand up" is itself a finding.

| Arm | Outcome | Friction |
|---|---|---|
| **A** CLI | Completed | Docs give a Windows install command that cannot work; only the beta channel is published; several commands return non-zero on success; commands are cwd-sensitive and invent plausible wrong answers; some `--help` subcommands hang |
| **B** MCP official | Completed | Reports `✓ Connected` while exposing **zero** tools without `com.unity.pipeline`; needs an Editor restart to resolve the package; server binds late. Once up: 140 tools, worked first time |
| **C** MCP CoplayDev | Completed | `uv` must be on the Editor's PATH **at launch** — installing it while Unity runs is unrecoverable without a restart; bundled README describes a UI that no longer exists; setup is GUI-only |

**Notable:** B was used to set up C — `menu` opened CoplayDev's own
configuration window. Cross-arm bootstrapping works.

**Verdict** — A is the only arm that can install anything, so it's not
optional. B was the least painful to reach a working state *given* the CLI
already existed. C cost the most human intervention, entirely because of the
GUI dependency.

**Follow-ups**
- Compare B and C on the same authoring task — the first real trial.
- `unity build` (A) vs `build` (B) on the same target.
- Does C offer anything B doesn't, beyond client breadth?
